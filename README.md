# RESTful API design
> For this challenge, you will need to design RESTful APIs for the following 3 businesses:

- a job board, like indeed, with job posts, companies, resumes, and applications.
- a social network like facebook, with friends, posts, and chat messages.
- a library, with books/movies, accounts, fines, and available computers.

## Requirements
> Answer the following questions for each of the 3 businesses. You do not need to submit any code for this exercise. You can describe these APIs using plain text. Think about resources, and actions on those resources.
- What resources do each of these apps need?
- What actions should a user (or an admin) be able to perform on these resources? What URL and HTTP request method should be used to perform these actions?
- Are these actions idempotent? In other words, does performing these actions more than once leave the server in a different state than performing them only once?
- What status codes should these operations return? Are the results cacheable?
